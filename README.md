# What is "Comepetitive Programming"?
 - Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers(Wikipedia).
 
 - I am interested in Competetive Programming to improve my programming and problem solving skills.
 
 - There are a lot of platforms outside there but I am using [codeforce](https://codeforces.com/)
 
 - Also I have solved couple of problems on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptYE67pT4RU&list=PLB3scnRGX8FBaLBkiRtP8ljI1VfulGekl). Check it out. 
 
 ## How things works at codeforces?
 - Each problem has problem statement, sample input and sample output. Programmers task is writing,required program, in any language, that maps all inputs to correct outputs. For example for [this problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1095/A): 

### Problem statement:
![problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56651041/111890031-e876ec00-89f6-11eb-9988-9dedb1a5b181.PNG)
### Sample inputs and outputs:

### After understading problem, programmer should come up with correct and efficient algorithm to solve problem. Like this:

### After that, solution program file(c++, java, python etc.) must be submitted, if all input mathches correct output with respecting memory and time constrains problem solved. Codeforces tests submitted code and reports if something wrong in the code. Here are the tests that my program passed:
