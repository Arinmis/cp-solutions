# What is "Comepetitive Programming"?
 - Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers(Wikipedia).
 
 - I am interested in Competetive Programming to improve my programming and problem solving skills.
 
 - There are a lot of platform outside there but I am using [codeforce](https://codeforces.com/)
 
 ## How things works at codeforces?
 - Each problem has problem statement, sample input and sample output. Programmers task is writing,required program, in any language, that maps all inputs to correct outputs. For example for [this problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1095/A): 

### Problem statement:
![problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56651041/111890031-e876ec00-89f6-11eb-9988-9dedb1a5b181.PNG)
### Sample inputs and outputs:

### After understading problem, programmer should come up with correct and efficient algorithm to solve problem. Like this:
![my-solution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56651041/111890033-e90f8280-89f6-11eb-9b63-668d2498cc55.PNG)

### After that, solution program file(c++, java, python etc.) must be submitted, if all input mathches correct output with respecting memory and time constrains problem solved. Codeforces does "unit test" and report if something wrong in your code. Here is tests that my program passed:

# I've solved up to 200 comptetetive programming problem, here my is stats:
